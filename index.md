## Current Projects

### **Network Monitoring Tool**
A script designed to monitor network traffic and detect anomalies in real-time. This project involves creating a dashboard that provides a visual overview of network activity and potential threats.

### **Web Security Scanner**
A tool to scan websites for security vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other common web application threats. This scanner helps identify and mitigate risks before they can be exploited.

- **Firewall Configurations**: Understanding the setup and management of firewalls to protect network infrastructure.
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Exploring the implementation and use of IDS to monitor network traffic for suspicious activities.
- **Penetration Testing**: Learning the techniques to test network and web applications for vulnerabilities.
